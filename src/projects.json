Features include support for 2-15 players (with better support for large groups 6+ than previous apps), allowing user customization on matches (ex. timer, match title), consulting the Scryfall API with autocomplete prompts for commanders and cards, and managing player stats with an intuitive UI. My friends were delighted to see the final product as a tool for the game, and the implemented features sped our matches up by 50%",
